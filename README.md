## Description
This project contains R scripts for gene expression analysis using microarray data from two different datasets: GSE62232 and GSE121248. The analysis includes preprocessing, differential expression analysis, functional enrichment analysis, and downstream processing steps.

## File Description

1. GO_Kegg.Rmd
This R Markdown file contains code for analyzing gene expression data from the GSE62232 dataset.
It covers steps such as data retrieval, preprocessing, differential expression analysis, heatmap visualization, GO enrichment analysis, KEGG pathway analysis, and downstream processing.
2. motif_analysis.Rmd
This R Markdown file contains code for analyzing gene expression data from the GSE121248 dataset.
Similar to the first file, it includes data retrieval, preprocessing, analysis, and processes for motif analysis
